Hitachi S4160 Restoration Project
=============

This is the repository for files, programs and documentation relating to PSU's nanogroup Hitachi s4160 restoration project.  While much of it has yet to be written, the documentation for this proect can be found in the wiki, as well as the microscope manuals found in the lab.  This LabVIEW program is designed to gather digital images off of the video out signal found on the back of the SEM.
